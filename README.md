Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings

Project Description:
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Airbnb listings in Seattle, WA. The objective of the analysis was to gain insights into the Airbnb activity, understand the characteristics of listings, and identify trends and patterns in the data.

Steps Implemented:
1. Data Collection:
The dataset consists of three CSV files: calendar, listings, and reviews, obtained from the Airbnb Inside initiative. The data includes listing activity, full descriptions, average review scores, and detailed comments.
2. Data Exploration:
Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure, including the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics.
3. Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and cleaned the data by filling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data inconsistencies.
4. Basic Statistics:
Calculated and visualized basic statistics such as the average price of listings, distribution of property types, and distribution of neighborhoods.
5. Visualization:
6. Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to explore relationships and trends in the data, including price distributions, room type preferences, and the number of listings by neighborhood.
7. Correlation Analysis:
Investigated correlations between different features to identify relationships, such as the correlation between the number of bedrooms and the price, or the impact of reviews on booking rates.
8. Data Insights:
Summarized findings and provided insights from the analysis, including interesting patterns, trends, popular neighborhoods, and factors influencing listing prices.
9. Conclusion:
The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the Airbnb activity in Seattle. The analysis shed light on the characteristics of listings, seasonal trends, and factors influencing pricing and booking rates. The findings can inform decision-making for both hosts and guests, and serve as a foundation for further analysis and modeling.
